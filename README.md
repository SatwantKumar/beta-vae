# beta-vae
A Pytorch Implementation of the β-VAE :)

# Face Generation Using Variational Autoencoders
This repo containing training code for two different VAEs implemented with Pytorch.

I used the [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) Dataset for training, with 182637 training images and 19962 testing images.

Model implementations are based on the [β-VAE](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy2fzU9gl) and the [DFC-VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00291).

trained model can be found in [/samples](/samples).
